Actually, I am in really bad shape financially. I pay money to my ex-wife as part of our divorce settlement, among other bills... I just had no choice but to make you pay for lunch the other day, I'm really sorry.

I was a North American Fall Webworm in my past life. Those were the good old days... What were you in your former life?
