			<!-- generic creation -->
			<li>creation->In an empire broken by virtueless [foeSoldiers], [founderName] took [place_name] into [founder_possessive] own hands and received the Mandate of Heaven.</li>
			<li>creation->From generation to generation the Mandate of the former dynasty had degenerated under the influence of the [foeSoldiers]. [founderName] alone saw the path ordained by heaven.</li>
			<li>creation->During an era when a cruel [foeLeader] had taken over the [place_powerCenter] of [place_name] with the backing of his ruthless [foeSoldiers], [founderName] gathered together virtuous men and women to restore harmony to the world.</li>

			<!-- generic episode -->
			<li>episode(uses=1)->Many battles were fought and many clever schemes carried out by [founder_possessive] generals before the [foeLeader] was finally overthrown and order restored.</li>
			<li>episode(uses=1)->The [foeLeader] amassed a million man army and marched on [founderName]'s lands, but through the clever application of [place_massWeapon], the righteous were able to score a great victory. </li>
			<li>episode(uses=1)->[founderName]'s sworn brothers were killed in the war against the [foeLeader]. [founder_pronoun] was devastated by the loss and was never quite the same again.</li>
			<li>episode(uses=1)->Conscription of [place_job]s into the army proved to be a valuable tool in eventually overcoming the enemy and taking back the Empire. Most were equipped with crude [place_personalWeapon]s, but their zeal more than made up for it.</li>
